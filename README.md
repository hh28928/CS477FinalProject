# Make-Save
Final Project
Save & Make will be an App, a platform that will consist of two types of users; A costumer & a Service Provider. 

The cotumer will be able to submit a job request, lets assume he or she needs help in cleaning their apartment, they can go on Save & Make, if they don’t have an account then they can register as a costumer, and post the job. 

The Service Provider will get a notification that someone in their area has posted a job, they can go on Save & Make and see the details of that job, if they like what they see then they have the opportunity to Apply for it. 
Of course they will get the notification after they create an account and register as a Service Provider and set their account (qualification, bank info…) 

After the Service Provider applies for a job, they will have to wait for the costumer to accept, during this time, the costumer will get a chance to review the proposal, the qualification of the service provier and their rating. 

The proposal that will be made by the service provider will consist mainly of the price they will charge, the costumer will be able to review that and check the qualifications. 

Now that we gave an idea of what the app will do, lets talk about why people will use it. 
When you contact a company, a cleaning company, you will have to pay for the Cleaner and the company, but through Save & Make you will only have to compensate the the cleaner. Thus, saving money. 

	•	The app will include:
	•	a map interface that shows the location of the user and costumer. 
	•	We will be using FireBase which is made by Google as a database. 
	•	We will using some sort of an API to process payments
